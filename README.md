# C++ Tutorial for Competitive Programming (CP)
This is for entry-level programmers, who need to take CP test using C++ with little experience.
As I am one of them, the contents were referred from generated text in a great size.
What I've contributed is reorganizing, trimming and add some comments on them.  

# Index
* 01 ~ 10: Basic syntax of C++
* 11 ~ 20: Basic algorithm for CP using C++ 
* Dynamic Programming (DP): Fibonacci, Coin change, Knapsack

# Todo
* Sort: Bubble, Selection, Quick (13, 14, 15)
* Search: Binary, ... (18)
* Structure: Linked list, Heap, Priority-Queue, Hash-table (12, 20)
* Graph: BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford (16, 17)
* Bit Manipulation (19)

## Advanced
* String algorithms
* Segment tree
* Trie
* MST: Prim, Kruskal

# Misc.
* There would be no mention about time complexity for each algorithm.
* The following algorithm won't be covered in this tutorial:
    * Number-theory (e.g., GCD)
    * Backtracking
