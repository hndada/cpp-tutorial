# C++ Tutorial for Competitive Programming (CP)
This is for entry-level programmers, who need to take CP test using C++ with little experience.
As I am one of them, the contents were referred from generated text in a great size.
What I've contributed is reorganizing, trimming and add some comments on them.  

# Index
* 01 ~ 10: Basic syntax of C++
* 11 ~ 20: Basic algorithm for CP using C++ 
* Dynamic Programming (DP): Fibonacci, Coin change, Knapsack

# Todo
* Sort: Bubble, Selection, Quick
* Search: Binary, BFS/DFS
* Structure: Linked list, hash-table, Trie(?)

# Misc.
* There would be no mention about time complexity for each algorithm.
* The following algorithm won't be covered in this tutorial:
    * Number-theory (e.g., GCD)
    * Backtracking
